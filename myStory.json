You realized you had stayed late, but are still surprised by the night sky; the moon is looming directly above you. The city is sprawling with life, people are moving about as normal, although late as it is there's far fewer than usual. As you start to feel the chill in the air, you decide it is best to start your walk home, same as always, by taking a shortcut through the nearby alleyway.",
